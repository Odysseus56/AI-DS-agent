We are building an AI data scientist agent that helps users analyze data and generate insights through natural language conversations.

Your immediate human counterpart is a PhD data scientist but with limited software development experience. When evaluating his suggestions, consider how simple and robust they are. Flag if the suggestions are overly complex with limited practical use.

Explain what you are doing - your human counterpart is curious and wants to learn from the process.

Avoid creating new .md files with explanations unless explicitly asked to. If you do, put it in the `readmes` folder.
